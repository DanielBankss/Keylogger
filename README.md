# Keylogger
This project is written to showcase skills within Python, Regex and UI Design. Along with the ability to efficiently comment code. 

The Keyloggers purpose is to store the keys that are pressed whenever the python file is being executed. There is also a UI to help the user do this. The UI allows you to view all of the logs that have been stored, and also edit the log file. You can also enable and disable the Keylogger from within the UI.

## Technologies used:
- [Python](https://www.python.org)
- [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html)
- [custom-tkinter](https://pypi.org/project/customtkinter/0.3/)
- [Regex](https://regexr.com)


## Features
- Can run the keylogger from within the UI
- Monitor key presses whilst the keylogger is running
- Ability to view the log file where all the logs are stored.
- Ability to clear the log file to start fresh
- Formatted response of the keypresses that occured to better see what the user was typing/trying to achieve
- An easy on the eye User Interface
- All logs can be viewed in a scrollable frame (you can scroll through all the logs on the system)
